# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy implemented for our project using Cypress, an end-to-end testing framework. The tests are designed to automate the validation of various functionalities within our application, ensuring that all features perform as expected before deployment.

## Test Plan
The test suite includes multiple scenarios covering different parts of the application:

- **User Authentication**: Tests for login, logout, and session management.
- **User Management**: Tests for adding, editing, and deleting users.
- **Profile Management**: Tests to edit user profiles and manage user-specific settings.
- **Inventory Management**: Tests for adding, editing, filtering, and deleting inventory items.

## Reasoning Behind the Test Plan
The tests are constructed to simulate user interactions with the application, from initial setup to daily operations. This approach is chosen because:

- **Realistic Scenarios**: By simulating real-world usage, we can uncover functional and integration issues that might not be apparent during manual testing.
- **Repeatability**: Automated tests can be run any number of times, ensuring consistent results without additional effort.
- **Regression Testing**: Any future changes to the application can be validated against the established test cases to ensure no new bugs are introduced.

## Test Descriptions

### Initial Setup
- **Initial Setup Test**: Ensures that the first-time setup process for new users works as intended. This is crucial for onboarding new users without manual intervention.

### Authentication
- **Login and Logout Tests**: Validate that the authentication process handles both valid and invalid credentials correctly and that sessions are appropriately managed.

### User Management
- **Add and Remove User Tests**: Ensure that only authorized users can add or remove users from the system, reflecting changes immediately across the application.

### Profile Management
- **Edit Profile Test**: Checks the functionality to update user details such as usernames and passwords, crucial for maintaining user account security.

### Inventory Management
- **Add/Edit/Delete Inventory Items**: Tests the core functionalities of inventory management, which is a critical component of the application, especially for businesses relying on precise stock tracking.

### Purchases Management
- **Add/Delete Purchase**: Tests the ability to add and delete purchases, ensuring that the inventory is updated correctly and that the purchase history is maintained accurately. Additionally aloows addiition of purchase date and quantity, to update the relevent low and out of stock inventory items.

### Job Management
- **Manage Jobs and Job-related Details**: Tests the functionalities involved in managing jobs within the application. This includes adding new jobs, editing existing jobs, deleting jobs, managing necessary and used parts associated with jobs, and handling job estimates.
