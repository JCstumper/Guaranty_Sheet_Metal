# EditProfilePopup Component Documentation

## Overview

`EditProfilePopup` is a React component designed to allow users to edit their profile information, such as username, password, and email, within a modal popup. This component provides form inputs for entering new values and communicates changes back to the parent component through callbacks.

## Usage

- **`isOpen`**: Boolean to control the visibility of the modal.
- **`onSave`**: Function to handle saving the new user data.
- **`onClose`**: Function to close the modal without saving changes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visibility**: Renders the modal only if `isOpen` is true.
- **Form Inputs**: Includes text inputs for username, password, and email.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides buttons for immediate actions to save or cancel changes.
- **Accessibility**: Includes a close button accessible by keyboard and screen readers.

## Styling

The component utilizes styles from the `AddProduct.css` file, which should contain styles for modal components, including backgrounds, form elements, and buttons. It's important to ensure that this CSS file contains the necessary styles for `.modal-backdrop`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-body`, and `.modal-actions`.

## Interaction Flow

1. **Opening the Modal**: The modal appears when `isOpen` is set to true.
2. **Editing Information**: Users can enter new values for their username, password, and email.
3. **Saving Changes**: Users can save their changes by clicking the "Save Changes" button, which triggers the `onSave` callback.
4. **Canceling Changes**: Users can cancel and close the modal by clicking the "Cancel" button or the close button (`Ã—`) in the modal header.

## Best Practices

- **Clear Initial State**: Ensure the input fields are reset each time the modal opens to avoid leftover data being displayed.
- **Validate Inputs**: Implement input validation for email and password strength to enhance security and user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the modal is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.

## Accessibility

- **Focus Management**: Focus should be managed to enter the modal when opened and return to the originating element when closed.
- **Keyboard Navigability**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Use appropriate ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility, including roles and properties for the modal.

## Example Use Case

This component is suitable for use in web applications where users need to frequently update their profile information. It's particularly useful in user-centric applications like e-commerce platforms, social networks, or any system requiring user profiles.

## Dependencies

- `react-toastify` for displaying success or error notifications upon saving data could enhance user feedback but is not implemented in the provided code.

Make sure all dependencies are properly managed and the environment is correctly configured for the component to function effectively.
