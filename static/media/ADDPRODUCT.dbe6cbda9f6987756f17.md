### Context Integration

Utilizes `AppContext` for accessing the global `API_BASE_URL`, ensuring all API interactions are centralized.

## State Management

- **Form States**: Manages the state of form fields to capture product details.
- **Upload States**: Tracks the status of file uploads and parsing operations.

## API Interactions

- **Fetch Products**: Retrieves current inventory to ensure the application displays up-to-date information.
- **Add Product**: Sends new product data to the backend for storage.
