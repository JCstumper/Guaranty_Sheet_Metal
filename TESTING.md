# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy implemented for our project using Cypress, an end-to-end testing framework. The tests are designed to automate the validation of various functionalities within our application, ensuring that all features perform as expected before deployment.

## Test Plan
The test suite includes multiple scenarios covering different parts of the application:

- **User Authentication**: Tests for login, logout, and session management.
- **User Management**: Tests for adding, editing, and deleting users.
- **Profile Management**: Tests to edit user profiles and manage user-specific settings.
- **Inventory Management**: Tests for adding, editing, filtering, and deleting inventory items.

## Reasoning Behind the Test Plan
The tests are constructed to simulate user interactions with the application, from initial setup to daily operations. This approach is chosen because:

- **Realistic Scenarios**: By simulating real-world usage, we can uncover functional and integration issues that might not be apparent during manual testing.
- **Repeatability**: Automated tests can be run any number of times, ensuring consistent results without additional effort.
- **Regression Testing**: Any future changes to the application can be validated against the established test cases to ensure no new bugs are introduced.

## Test Descriptions

### Initial Setup
- **Initial Setup Test**: Ensures that the first-time setup process for new users works as intended. This is crucial for onboarding new users without manual intervention.

### Authentication
- **Login and Logout Tests**: Validate that the authentication process handles both valid and invalid credentials correctly and that sessions are appropriately managed.

### User Management
- **Add and Remove User Tests**: Ensure that only authorized users can add or remove users from the system, reflecting changes immediately across the application.

### Profile Management
- **Edit Profile Test**: Checks the functionality to update user details such as usernames and passwords, crucial for maintaining user account security.

### Inventory Management
- **Add/Edit/Delete Inventory Items**: Tests the core functionalities of inventory management, which is a critical component of the application, especially for businesses relying on precise stock tracking.

## Conclusion
The tests were designed to be comprehensive yet manageable for developers to maintain. By targeting the most critical areas of the application, we ensure a robust product that meets the functional requirements and delivers a smooth user experience.
