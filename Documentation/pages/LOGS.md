# Logs Component Documentation

## Overview

The `Logs` component is designed to display and manage inventory logs within the application. It offers functionalities for viewing log details, applying filters to search logs, and handling user interactions through a modal interface for filtering.

## Functionalities

### Log Display

- **View Logs**: Displays a list of all logs related to inventory actions, such as additions, deletions, and updates. Each log entry shows details like action type, username, log type, change details, and the timestamp of the action.

### Filter Modal

- **Open Filter Modal**: Activates a modal that allows users to filter logs by user or action type.
- **Apply Filters**: Applies selected filters to refine log entries displayed.
- **Reset Filters**: Clears all applied filters and shows all logs.

### Context Integration

Utilizes `AppContext` to access global settings like `API_BASE_URL`, ensuring API requests are consistent and managed centrally.

## State Management

- **Local States**:
  - `originalLogs`: Stores the initial set of logs fetched from the server.
  - `logs`: Maintains the set of logs currently displayed, which can be filtered.
  - `isFilterModalVisible`: Controls the visibility of the filter modal.
  - `userFilter` and `actionTypeFilter`: Store user inputs for log filtering.

## API Interactions

- **Fetch Logs**: Retrieves logs from the server using the `API_BASE_URL`. Handles both the initial fetch and subsequent fetches influenced by user actions or filters.

## Error Handling

Implements error handling for API interactions, providing feedback for fetch errors or issues during the data handling process using `toast` notifications.

## Accessibility

Ensures that all interactive elements are accessible and usable, including modal operations and form controls for filtering logs.

## Usage

This component is typically used within the administrative or management sections of the application, where monitoring and auditing of inventory actions are necessary. It provides administrative users with the tools needed to oversee and analyze changes within the inventory system.

## Security Features

- Ensures that sensitive log information is protected and only accessible based on user authentication and appropriate permissions.
- Uses secure API calls for fetching logs, integrating with the overall security strategy of the application.

## Modals and Dynamic Content

- **Filter Logs Modal**: Allows users to dynamically filter the logs based on specified criteria. This modal includes form inputs for user and action type filters and provides buttons to apply, reset, or close the modal.

## Styling and Layout

- Uses CSS from `Logs.css` and `AddProduct.css` for styling the component and modal interfaces, ensuring a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application.
