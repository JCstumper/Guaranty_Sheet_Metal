# NotFound Component Documentation

## Overview

The `NotFound` component is designed to handle scenarios where a user navigates to a route that does not exist within the application. It provides user feedback about the error and redirects them back to a login page after a short delay.

## Usage

This component is typically used in React applications as part of routing logic, specifically within the context of a `Switch` or `Routes` component to catch any undefined routes.

## Features

- **Automatic Redirection**: After displaying an error message, it automatically redirects the user to the login page after five seconds.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides an immediate error message explaining that the requested page is unavailable.
- **Manual Redirection Option**: Includes a button to manually redirect to the login page for immediate action.

## Structure

- **Error Message**: Informs the user that the page cannot be found and that they will be redirected.
- **Redirection Mechanism**: Uses a timeout to automatically navigate back to the login page.
- **Manual Redirect Button**: Allows users to immediately navigate to the login page without waiting for the timeout.

## Styling

The component utilizes styles from `NotFound.css` to ensure that the presentation is consistent with the rest of the application's design. This includes styling for the container, title, messages, and buttons.

## Interactivity

- **Automatic Timeout**: Automatically sets a timer to redirect the user, which is cleared if the component unmounts before the timeout completes.
- **Button**: Provides a button for users who prefer to navigate immediately rather than waiting for the automatic redirection.

## Best Practices

- **Clear Messaging**: Ensure the error message is clear and informs the user about what happened and what will happen next.
- **Graceful Handling of Unmounted Component**: Proper cleanup of the timeout to prevent actions from being called on an unmounted component.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that all elements are accessible, including keyboard navigation for the redirection button.

## Dependencies

Depends on:
- `react-router-dom` for navigation capabilities.
- React's `useEffect` for handling side effects related to redirection.

This component is essential for enhancing user experience by handling invalid routes gracefully, providing clear user feedback, and ensuring users are directed to a functional starting point within the application.
