# ConfirmModal Component Documentation

## Overview

The `ConfirmModal` component is a reusable confirmation modal used to prompt the user before they take a critical action. It appears over the content and requires user interaction to proceed or cancel the action.

## Usage

- **`isOpen`**: A boolean that controls whether the modal is visible. The modal renders its content only if `isOpen` is `true`.
- **`onClose`**: A function that is called when the user clicks the close (X) button or the cancel button. This typically handles closing the modal.
- **`onConfirm`**: A function that is called when the user clicks the confirm button. This function should handle the action associated with the confirmation.
- **`children`**: The content displayed in the body of the modal. This can be any React component or HTML elements that describe the action the user is confirming.

## Features

- Flexible content: The `children` prop allows the insertion of custom content into the modal body, making the modal adaptable for various confirmation scenarios.
- Two-button design: The modal provides a clear choice between confirming or canceling the intended action, guided by straightforward button interactions.

## Styling

- The modal's visibility and basic layout are controlled through the `ConfirmUsers.css` stylesheet. This file should contain styles for `.modal-backdrop`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-body`, and `.modal-actions`.
- The `.modal-backdrop` is styled to cover the entire viewport, typically making the background slightly opaque to focus on the modal.
- The `.modal-content` is designed to stand out from the backdrop, ensuring it draws the user's attention to the confirmation content.

## Accessibility

- The modal should manage focus appropriately by trapping it within the visible modal when open and returning focus to the initiating element upon closure.
- ARIA roles and attributes should be used to enhance accessibility, such as `role="dialog"` for the modal content and `aria-modal="true"`.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the modal does not interfere with the page's overall accessibility, particularly for users relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation.
- Implement the modal in a way that it responds appropriately to changes in device or browser dimensions, maintaining usability and appearance across platforms.

## Example Implementation

This component can be integrated into a form or a page where confirmation is required before submitting data or deleting important content. It provides clear user interaction patterns that help prevent accidental actions that could lead to data loss or other significant effects.
